# Damage claims analysis

### 1. Introduction
With millions of units shipped every year, handling issues leading to product damages are inevitable. But can we get insights from past claims to better understand the root causes of those issues? What consignees are claiming the most? What kind of products are mostly affected? Can we improve our packaging method? <br/>
Let's try to use our past data to shine some light on this matter!
